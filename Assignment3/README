Makefile rules:

Makefile in project folder (Assignment3_DPLKYL002):

[* - use these rules here]

make - compile this project folder only
*make all - compile the entire project
*make run args="***" - run the program
*make clean - clean the entire project
*make run_unit_tests

***huffencode <inputFileName> <outputFileName>

Note: 
- Don't include the angle brackets.

Run example:
make run args="huffencode test1.txt output/output"

Makefiles in /libs/huffmantreelib folders:
make - compile this folder only
make clean - clean this folder only

Explanation of what each file does and how it fits into the program as a whole:

HuffmanTree.cpp & HuffmanTree.h - These source and header files manages the Huffman tree and has methods to compress data, 
				build a Huffman tree etc - implements the compression and decompression functionality.
			
Huffencode.cpp - This driver source file contains the main function (entry point to the program). It parses the command line 
	 using the argc and argv values passed into main() and uses these arguments to invoke the correct operation function.
	 
Test.cpp - This source file provides unit tests for each of the sections of the code: frequency counting, tree construction, 
	code table construction (tree traversal), encoding, etc.

Explanation of (1) input file required by program:
***test1.txt - an input English (ASCII) text file

Explanation of (4) output files produced by program:
output1 - an output compressed "bitstream" file
***decompressed_test1.txt - decompressed file
**output1.hdr - code table file
**output1.bin - binary file

*** should be identical - shows that decompression works
** files required for decompression
